# Java Dynamic Data Structues
Stack, Queues, Priority Queues with interfaces and JUnit Testing

Implemented the MyStack, MyQueue and MyPriorityQueue interfaces using my implementations of Linked Lists: AList, ListChar and SnocList.
StackQueue uses Java's ArrayList.

Further developed 40 JUnit test cases to test the four classes, also testing for exceptions where necessary.
